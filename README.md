*DESCRIPTION*: For this project, I created a **Student Performance Dashboard in Power BI** by integrating data from **multiple sources**—specifically, an **Excel sheet** containing student details and a **CSV file** with marks and performance metrics. Using Power BI’s data connection tools, I imported both datasets and utilized the **Power Query Editor** to clean and transform the data, ensuring consistent formatting, removing duplicates, and creating calculated columns such as total marks, percentage, and rank. Relationships were established between tables based on unique student IDs. I then used **DAX measures** to calculate average scores, top-performing students per subject, and pass/fail status. The dashboard includes interactive **visualizations** such as top 3 students by subject, overall performance by class, subject-wise analysis, and slicers to filter by subject or grade. The deliverable is a **Power BI (.PBIX) report** that demonstrates successful **data integration** from different sources and presents key educational insights in a visually engaging format.
